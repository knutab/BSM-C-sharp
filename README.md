# BSM-C-sharp

This folder contains the project files with the code for my option price calculator written in C# using 
Microsoft Visual 2010 Express. 

The OptionPricing C# folder contains the project files. And the compiled release files.
The folder Release files contains the compiled program, and the required files to run the program. 

By just downloading the BSM.exe the program can run, but the documentation file is unavailable unless the whole folder is downloaded.

Release/app.publish also contains a installer for the program.
